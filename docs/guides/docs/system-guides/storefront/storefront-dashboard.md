# ðŸ’» Dashboard

ðŸ’¡ Storefront is a headless e-commerce service which functions as an extension withinÂ [Fleetbase](https://fleetbase.io/)

[Fleetbase Storefront](https://fleetbase.io/products/storefront) provides several API-first approaches to products, carts, categories, customers, and checkout flow giving developers more control over the shopping experience. 

This project is to provide an open-sourced hyperlocal shopping app which can be fully customised and adapted to personal and commercial projects. 

This Storefront app is built withÂ [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) to provide react native developers a head start building with Fleetbase and Storefront.

The dashboard is where you can manage all of your orders, customers, stores and current earnings.
